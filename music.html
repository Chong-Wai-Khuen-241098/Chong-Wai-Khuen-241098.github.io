      <h3>Music Releases & Achievements</h3>

         <h4>"See You Someday" (《你最近过得好吗》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 12 December 2023</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> One night, she dreamed of her mom—and that dream became the inspiration for this song. In the dream, her mother was wearing her favorite blue knitted sweater, the very first gift she ever received from her daughter, bought with her first paycheck. They sat together on a stone bench, facing the ocean her mom loved to visit before she passed. With her head gently resting on her mom’s shoulder, the peaceful moment was interrupted when her mom turned and softly asked, “Have you been doing well lately?”
She nodded silently.
Her mom smiled.
And then, slowly… she faded away once again from her world.</p>
        
        <h4>"If That Call Came Through" (《如果那通电话有接通》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 12 May 2024</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> This is a deeply emotional song written by her to mark the tenth Mother’s Day without her mother. It expresses how grief slowly seeps into everyday moments, how memories are triggered by familiar places and scents, and how absence becomes more real with time. The lyrics reflect her gratitude for the 15 years they shared and her longing to make her mother proud—ending with a heartfelt wish: "Happy Mother’s Day ❤️"</p>
        <p><strong>Award:</strong> In December 2024, it won the "Contemporary Pop Playlist" award at the TikTok Music Awards.</p>
        
        <h4>"See You" (《有天会再相见》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2 September 2024</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> She has always believed that everything we go through—every person we meet, every experience we face, whether good or bad—is part of the journey we’re meant to live. Even the sudden loss of someone we love deeply.

This song was written with that belief in mind. She knows that what you’re facing right now may not be easy. But she truly believes that life has more planned for you—something greater ahead.

In the final arrangement, she chose to blend two emotions: openness and sorrow. Because partings are never simple—they carry layers of feeling. This song is a blessing for what’s to come, and a full stop for what once was.

She hopes this piece brings you strength. That after letting go of the sadness, you'll be able to move forward again.
You can do it. She truly believes in you.</p>
        
        <h4>"Go Slow to Go fast" (《花期不同》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 10 October 2024</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> A rose takes 60 days to bloom from a seed.
A sunflower takes 80.
Seeds don’t become trees overnight,
And no flower starts out in full bloom.

So there’s no need to rush, no need to fear.
Climbing your own hill—at your own pace—is the quiet strength of ordinary people.
You are not behind.
You are not ahead.
Because everyone blooms in their own time.

Give yourself more kindness.
Give time a little more time.
It will lead you to the field of flowers meant for you.

How lucky we are—to still be on the journey.
As long as we keep walking, the flowers will bloom..</p>
        
        <h4>"Ah Dai" (《阿呆》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 26 February 2025</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong>This song tells the story of how she met "A-Dai," a non-living character that turned into a real cartoon. What started as a fun project led to her first brand ambassadorship and a trademark for A-Dai.

She loved the song’s arrangement from the first version—it has a magical way of lifting her spirits every time she listens.

She hopes the melody brings the same joy to you. If it does, she’ll be happy—because when you’re happy, she’s happy!</p>

                 <h4>"YOLO" (《人醒着不过一万多天》)</h4>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 31 March 2025</p>
        <p><strong>About:</strong> Life is short—about 30,000 days for an average person. A third of that time is spent asleep, and much of the rest is consumed by basic needs. In the end, we only have a small portion of time to truly experience and cherish life.

This song serves as a reminder to appreciate the present and savor the meaningful moments before they slip away. No one knows how long they have, so it's important to make every day count.

The song is for those beautiful moments and for the tears shed along the way, which will all be worth it in the end.</p>
